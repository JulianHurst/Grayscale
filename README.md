# Grayscale
A frontend specifically for ImageMagicks convert -colorspace gray option.

#Windows Users
Since a convert command already exists in windows ([http://ss64.com/nt/convert.html](http://ss64.com/nt/convert.html)), Windows users MUST download convert-to-convertim.bat and execute it as administrator or manually rename convert.exe to convert-im.exe in order for Grayscale to work.
